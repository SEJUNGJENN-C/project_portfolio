# Porfolio for Data Analytics Projects

### [Project 1: Bike Share Data Analysise](https://github.com/SEJUNGJENN-C/project_portfolio/tree/BikeShare)

This project is part of an online data analytics course, Udacity. I wrote a python script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal that answers questions about the dataset that users may have about the bike share data. For example, "Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?" The user's answers to the questions will determine the city and timeframe on which user will conduct data analysis.
